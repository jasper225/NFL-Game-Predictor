- **Interactive UI**: User-friendly interface built with Streamlit
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest classifier trained on historical game data
- **Team Statistics**: View detailed performance metrics for all NFL teams
- **Win Probability**: Get probability estimates with confidence levels
- **Visual Analytics**: Interactive charts and graphs using Plotly
- **Feature Importance**: Understand which factors drive predictions
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies, no heavy packages required

## 🎬 Demo

### Main Prediction Interface

```
Select teams → View stats → Get prediction → See win probabilities
```

### Key Metrics Displayed

- Win Rate
- Points Per Game (Offense)
- Points Allowed Per Game (Defense)
- Average Margin of Victory
- Feature Importance Rankings

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip package manager
- Internet connection (for fetching NFL data)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nfl-game-predictor.git
cd nfl-game-predictor
```

### Step 2: Create Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**requirements.txt:**

```txt
streamlit==1.29.0
pandas==2.1.4
numpy==1.26.2
scikit-learn==1.3.2
plotly==5.18.0
requests==2.31.0
```

## 💻 Usage

### Running the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default browser at `http://localhost:8501`

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Fetch Data**: Click "🔄 Fetch Data & Train Model" in the sidebar
2. **Wait for Training**: The app will fetch real NFL data and train the model (~30-60 seconds)
3. **Select Teams**: Choose home and away teams from the dropdowns
4. **View Stats**: Review current statistics for both teams
5. **Predict**: Click "🔮 Predict Game" to see the prediction
6. **Analyze Results**: View win probabilities and confidence levels

### Configuration Options

- **Season**: Select which NFL season to analyze (default: current)
- **Weeks to Include**: Choose how many weeks of data to use (1-18)

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Data Collection

The app uses ESPN's public API to fetch:

- Game schedules and results
- Team scores (home and away)
- Game status (completed games only)

```python
# ESPN API endpoint
https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/football/nfl/scoreboard
```

### 2. Feature Engineering

Calculated metrics for each team:

- **Win Rate**: Wins / Total Games
- **Points Per Game**: Average offensive output
- **Points Allowed Per Game**: Average defensive performance
- **Point Differential**: Net scoring advantage
- **Average Margin**: Average winning/losing margin

Derived features for predictions:

- Win Rate Difference (Home - Away)
- PPG Difference
- Defensive Rating Difference
- Margin Difference

### 3. Machine Learning Model

**Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier

- **Estimators**: 100 trees
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20
- **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler normalization
- **Cross-Validation**: Stratified sampling

**Training Features** (12 total):

```python
[
    'win_rate_home', 'win_rate_away', 'win_rate_diff',
    'points_per_game_home', 'points_per_game_away', 'ppg_diff',
    'points_allowed_per_game_home', 'points_allowed_per_game_away', 'papg_diff',
    'avg_margin_home', 'avg_margin_away', 'margin_diff'
]
```

### 4. Prediction Output

For each prediction, the model provides:

- **Binary Prediction**: Home Win (1) or Away Win (0)
- **Probability Estimates**: Confidence for each outcome
- **Confidence Level**: High (>70%), Medium (55-70%), Low (<55%)

- Model training: On-demand when user clicks "Fetch Data"

## 📈 Model Performance

### Typical Accuracy Metrics

- **Training Accuracy**: 65-75%
- **Test Accuracy**: 60-70%
- **Baseline Accuracy**: ~55% (home team advantage)

### Feature Importance (Typical Rankings)

1. Win Rate Difference (~25%)
2. Points Per Game Difference (~20%)
3. Defensive Rating Difference (~18%)
4. Average Margin Difference (~15%)
5. Other features (~22%)

### Known Limitations

- **Limited Historical Context**: Uses only current season data
